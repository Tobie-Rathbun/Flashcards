OSI Model  
    Open Systems Interconnect
    
OSI Layer 1 
    Physical Layer
        Cables, Physically moving bits of information
            Wire, Copper, Glass
OSI Layer 2 
    Data Link Layer
        Protocols that allow computers and other devices to communicate locally
        Individual hops between clients, switches, routers, cable modems, and internet
            Ethernet protocol (PC to Router, Router to Cable Modem, Internet to Server, Internet to Internet)
            DOCSIS-3 protocol (Cable Modem to Internet)
OSI Layer 3 
    Network Layer
        Gives the path through the network or internet to a server
        Uses the physical and data link layer to send messages long distances across a network
            IP - Internet Protocol, IP Addressing, IP Routing
OSI Layer 4  
    Transport Layer
        Sets up a session between PC and Server
            TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (typically used)
            UDP - User Datagram Protocol 
OSI Layer 5 
    Session Layer
        Not used, typically considered the Application layer
OSI Layer 6  
    Presentation Layer
        Not used anymore, ASCII to EBCDID (proprietary IBM)
OSI Layer 7  
    Application Layer
        Transfers specific types of data in a specific way
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP (Port 80), HTTPS (Port 443) (Secure Socket Layer [SSL], Transport Layer Security [TLS] which are the same thing)

    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (Network Layer 3)
    Server that hands out addresses for devices within an organization
    Built into your router, set up with a DHCP scope, excluding addresses etc.
        When seeking an address, workstation sends a Discover Message to the router
        Once received by DHCP Server, Server sends workstation DHCP Offer
            Workstation sends a request to confirm that it wants to use this IP
            Server acknowledges Workstation request
                Discover Message

Using DNS
    Forward DNS Lookup 
    Reverse DNS Lookup 
    DNS Record Types 

Forward DNS Lookup
    Workstation communicates to DNS server (Google DNS) and resolves IP address of a URL
        Google DNS responds with IP from URL
Reverse DNS Lookup
    Workstation sends IP to DNS Server
        DNS Server replies with URL if record is configured

\DNS Record Types
A -
    IPv4 Record
        32 Bits
        URL to IP Address
AAAA - 
    IPv6 Record
        URL to IP
        128 Bits
CNAME - 
    Canonical Name Record
    URL to URL
    gogle.com going to google.com
MX - 
    Mail Exchange Record
    Looks up where to send messages to certain domains
NS - 
    Indentifies Authoritative Name Server
    If DNS Server can't direct to IP, it can direct to NS responsible for IP of a site
PTR - 
    Pointer Record
    For reverse lookup
SRV - 
    Service Record
    Specify the IP and Port # of a Domain
TXT - 
    Text record for miscellaneous use
    Reserved for notes and documentation

\DNS
Internal vs. External DNS
    Workstation first checks with Internal DNS to resolve an IP from a URL
        If it can't be resolved, Internal DNS then checks with External DNS (Google DNS)
            If it can't be resolved External DNS checks with Root DNS Server
                Root DNS Server looks at Authoritative Name Server and sends data to External DNS
                Authoritative Name Servers are often accompanied by Secondary Name Servers
                    Zone Transfer over DNS Port 53, using TCP
                External DNS can then query Authoritative Name Server
                External DNS and Local DNS will cache this information
                    TTL - Time to Live
                        SOA - Start of Authority
                            Contains TTL data for long a name should be kept before having to go all the way back up to Root DNS Server

/Ethernet Terms and Concepts
CSMA / CD - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
    All devices connected on same coax cable 
    Waited to send signals until no other device was talking
    5 volt signal, if wire hit 10 volts (2 signals) then Collision
        All devices stop talking, wait, then listen, then retransmit
Collision Domains 
    Group of networked devies that will simultaneously detect a voltage spike
    Not used in modern networks, few collisions in modern networks 

Half duplex 
    One device communicates at a time 
    If wire is long enough, two devices can send a message at the same time, causing a voltage spike 
Full duplex 
    Two devices communicate at a time "Telephone"
    No possibility of collisions, modern networks

        Workstation < Router < Cable Modem - Layer 2 Bridge (Ethernet to DOCSIS [Pulls packet out of frame]) < Internet < Server
            Internet is full of Routers 
Message 
    Layer 2 Frame 
        IP Packet
            Source IP Address 
            Destination IP Address 
            TTL - Time to Live 
            Other  
ICMP - 
    Internet Message Control Protocol
    What ping uses to senda message and receive a response 
        Ping sets the source and destination in the IP Packet 
ARP - 
    Address Resolution Protocol 
    Finds out MAC Address information from an IP on a Local Network 
    Sends ARP request in a Frame Header 
        Destination MAC Address is set to all F's so all devices get asked 
        Source MAC Address is known, and Data section is set to ARP 
            Device with matching IP stores Source
                Sends to ARP Source, Data section is ARP, Payload is IP / MAC Address info 
    Maintains an ARP Cache (Table)
        Reduces ARP Request frequency
        ARP Cache will age out of entries 
            Stores MAC Addresses for limited time to allow for IP changes 
        ARP Table is not MAC Address table 

CMD arp -a 
    Displays ARP Table 

IGMP
    Internet Group Management Protocol 
    Windows uses to discover other devices on a network 
    Pinging an IP and receiving the MAC Address will update the ARP Table 

Default Gateway 
    ARP Requests can't be sent over the Internet
Routing Table on PC
    Knows how to reach Local Network 
    Puts Router as Destination, IPv4 as Data 
Gateway (Router)
    Checks routing table to see if it can find the IPv4 destination from the payload
        Builds New Frame, TTL Decreased by 1
        Queues message, Sends ARP Request to Found Device to retrieve MAC Address 
            Places as Destination MAC Address in New Frame
            Saves MAC Address to ARP Cache 
        New Frame has Old Payload and Reaches Found Device 
            Found Device can then Reply to Ping

        Abandon default VLAN 
    Disable Switch Ports that Aren't Used 
    Make Use of Private VLANs 
        Having a VLAN for just 1 or 2 devices defends againts ARP Spoof or man-in-the-middle attacks
